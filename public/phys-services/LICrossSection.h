///Encapsulates cross section information for one physical process with a
///two-body final state.
///
///Cross sections are stored as a pair of photospline objects: one spline for
///the differential cross section, and one for the total cross section. The
///latter could be derived from the former, but is included to avoid users
///having to repeatedly integrate the differential spline numerically.
///
///The differential spline must have three dimensions:
/// - log10 of incoming neutrino energy in GeV
/// - log10 of final state x
/// - log10 of final state y
///The value of the spline must be the log10 of the cross section.
///The absolute value of the differential cross section is never used, so its
///units are not important, however it is advisable that it should be consistent
///with the total cross section (see below).
///
///The total spline must have one dimension, which is log10 of incoming neutrino
///energy in GeV. The value of the spline must be the log10 of the total cross
///section in square meters.
