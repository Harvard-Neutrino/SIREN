Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the name of the
directory where the rk package should install its "rk.pc" file
(usually, this directory is /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ).

A typical rk package installation can proceed as follows.
If you are using an csh-type shell, do

setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

or, for an sh-type shell

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

Then run the following sequence of commands:

./configure --with-pic
make
make install

The last step may have to be performed as root. Run

./configure --help

to view available configuration options.
